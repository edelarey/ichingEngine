ichingEngine

This ichingEngine is a computerised / digital version of the Book of Changes (Yi Jing, I Ching, Yi Ching).
The project is entered into the public domain as part of ongoing research into the computational properties, possibilities and uses of the Changes.

The project's aim is to deploy a version of the engine which may be run in the cloud and accessed via webservice. 
The core engine will also run directly in a java based environment and thus be directly deployable on java capable devices.

The initial upload is the start of the core Engine expressed as as 4 Enumerations consisting of Single Lines (Yao), TwoLines (Bigram)
Three Lines (Trigram, BaGua) and 6 Lines (Hexagram). Yao form Bigrams, BaGua and Hexagrams.

The Engine is capable of producing the hexagrams in different sequences drawing the constituents in minimal ways.

Lines are generated via simulated coin toss. Other methods of line generation will be built in as the project progress.

I will continue to develop this engine further, and would be happy to have anyone with a deep interest in coding The Changes on board.
