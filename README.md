ichingEngine

This ichingEngine is a computerised / digital version of the Book of Changes (Yi Jing, I Ching, Yi Ching).
It is entered into the public domain as part of ongoing research into the computational poroperties, posibilities and uses of the Changes.

The projects aim is to deploy a version of the engine which may be run in the cloud and accessed via webservice. 
The core engine will also run directly in a java based environment and thus be directly deployable on java capable devices.

The initial upload is the start of the core Engine expressed as as 4 Enumerations consisting of Single Lines (Yao), TwoLines (Bigram)
Three Lines (Trigram, BaGua) and 6 Lines (Hexagram). Yao form Bigrams, BaGua and Hexagrams.

The Engine is capable of producing the hexagrams in different sequences drawing the constituents in minimal ways.

I will continue to develop this engine further, and would be happy to have anyone with a deep interest in coding The Changes on board.
